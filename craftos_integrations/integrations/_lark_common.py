"""Shared Lark scaffolding — used by every Lark-service integration.

Underscore prefix → autoloader skips this module. It's package-internal,
imported by ``lark.py`` (messaging) and ``lark_drive.py``, with future
siblings (calendar, docs, bitable, …) following the same shape.

What it provides
----------------

  - ``LarkCredential`` — single dataclass shape for every Lark service's
    credential file. All services share the same shape because all use
    the same Custom App's App ID + Secret + cached tenant_access_token.
    Bot-specific fields (``bot_name``, ``bot_open_id``) are populated
    only by the messaging integration; non-messaging services leave
    them empty.

  - ``LARK_API_BASE`` — the global Lark host. Feishu (China region)
    differs only in this constant; the API surface is identical.

  - ``validate_and_mint_token(app_id, app_secret)`` — one-shot credential
    validation used by every handler's ``login()``. Returns
    ``(token, expires_at, error)``.

  - ``ensure_token(cred, cred_file)`` — refresh-if-needed token getter.
    Mutates ``cred`` in place and persists to ``cred_file`` when a
    refresh actually happens. Each service holds its own credential
    file with its own cached token (no cross-service sharing).

  - ``make_headers(cred, cred_file)`` — bearer + JSON content-type. All
    Lark REST calls use this shape.

Why a separate file per service uses its own credential file
-------------------------------------------------------------

Even though every Lark service is authorized via the *same* Custom App,
the user wires each service as a sibling integration in the registry
(matches the ``google_*.py`` pattern). Each gets its own ``IntegrationSpec``
with its own ``cred_file`` so that connect/disconnect status is
per-service in the UI. The user pastes the same App ID + Secret into
each one — slight UX redundancy, paid back in clean independence
between services.
