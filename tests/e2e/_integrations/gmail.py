"""Gmail-specific verification helpers for live e2e tests.

All the Gmail API specifics live here:
  - the owner identifier is ``cred.email`` (stored on ``GoogleCredential``).
  - sent emails live in the ``SENT`` label and are queried via Gmail's
    search syntax (``in:sent``, ``after:`` for time bounds, free-text for
    body matches).
  - the underlying ``send_email`` / ``list_emails`` / etc. on the client
    are sync (REST), unlike WhatsApp's async bridge methods.

Tests just call ``recent_sent_emails(contains=...)`` and assert on the
returned list — no GmailAPI plumbing leaks into the test body.
