"""Level-1 smoke tests: action registry + simulated handlers.

Cheapest layer of the testing pyramid. Verifies:
1. The action registry loads at all.
2. Actions the agent's routing depends on exist.
3. An action's test_payload + simulated_mode flow runs end-to-end.

These tests do NOT boot the full agent (no LLM, no DB, no integrations).
See test_action_router.py for level-2 tests that mock the LLM and exercise
ActionRouter routing decisions.
