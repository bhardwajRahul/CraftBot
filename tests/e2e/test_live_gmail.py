"""LIVE end-to-end scenarios for Gmail.

Same black-box shape as the whatsapp suite: build the real agent, send
it a chat message via the production entry point, let it do its full
lifecycle, then ask Gmail itself "is there a matching email in my Sent
folder?" or assert which read-action the agent invoked.

Generic infrastructure lives in [_harness/](tests/e2e/_harness/);
Gmail-specific verification lives in
[_integrations/gmail.py](tests/e2e/_integrations/gmail.py).

**Opt-in.** Default ``pytest`` runs skip these. Run with::

    python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_live_gmail.py -v -m live -s

They spend LLM tokens and send REAL emails to your own inbox.
