"""LIVE end-to-end scenarios for WhatsApp.

One file per integration so test files stay scoped and easy to grow.
Generic infrastructure lives in [_harness/](tests/e2e/_harness/);
WhatsApp-specific verification lives in
[_integrations/whatsapp.py](tests/e2e/_integrations/whatsapp.py).

Each test:

1. Builds the real agent (skips if whatsapp_web isn't connected).
2. Sends a chat message through the same entry point the CraftBot UI uses.
3. After the agent's full lifecycle finishes, verifies the outcome
   black-box:
     - send tests: ``whatsapp.recent_messages_in_self_chat(...)``
     - read tests: ``assert_action_called(agent, <expected action>)``
4. Writes a per-test log file under ``tests/e2e/logs/`` with the agent
   trace + full LLM transcript.

**Opt-in.** Default ``pytest`` runs skip these. Run with::

    python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_live_whatsapp.py -v -m live -s

They spend LLM tokens and send REAL WhatsApp messages to the linked
account's own number.
